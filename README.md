Layout: 
- Home page: In the home page, i wanted a clear layout in order to engage the user, I used headigns to indicate what each paragrapgh was about as well as using images to break the info up. I placed the map towards the right, as I think it flows better to read about Aberdeen first as background knowledge before looking at the map. I outlined the map in order to enhance it. I used the image placements to break up the information a bit more. 
- History Page: I decided that the history page should hold more text content in order to web users to collect some background history, adding an image will hopefully make it easier for the web user to image what is was like. I included an external link fro Robert the Bruce as I assume non-scottish web users will not know who he is, this allows users to extend there research further.   
- Visit Page: I used a 7:5 column ratio within this page, this separates the information. I also added bootstrap pop ups for a info box about the attraction, i think this break the information up a little bit and gives the user more interaction within this website. 

Navigation: 
- All pages include the same navigation, this provides order to the website. I used buttons and links to each pages to form these buttons. When hovering over a button, the button will change color, showing which button you can select. As well as having active buttons, this meaning whichever page the user is on, the button will be a different shade of purple. This allows user clearly see which page they are currently on. 
- I also added icons to the nav buttons, I think this make it clearly to what each page is about but also gives an nice presentation.

Color Choices: 
- I used the color purple for the layout of all pages. I used purple for main headings as well as a white background. I think this makes the website look clear and distinct. I did try to make the background purple however i thought it made the pictures look misplaces and some of the colors clashed, therefore i selected the basic white background. Although there isn't an association with purple and Aberdeen, I used purple as i Like the color. 

Challenges faced:
- One challenge that i faced was whilst doing my git commits. I realized that i had to make a token and use that token to sign into my git account instead of my password.
- Another challenge that i face was with the 7:5 ratio, mainly with figuring out what is was. It took me a while to relaise that the 7:5 ratio was 12 columns split by 7 and 5. And when trying tp place my boxes, I had to select ho many columns i wanted the box to take up, this took me a while to get the sizing correct to how I wanted them. As well as styling these boxes. I found it hard to keep the boxes where they are without moving up or down within the styles i was using. 
- I struggled to connect my git to the Codio, and took some time to make a new repository as well as using the token 
- General styles: I struggles with some basic styles as i started without an external styles sheet Thereofre I had all of the styles internally within the html pages. This made code replication present but also made some issues as depedning on where i put the style and what it afrected may have been different to what i wanted. Thereofer, it was easier to have an external styles sheet in order to apply styles to multiple tags/code. As well as also having some internal styles too.
