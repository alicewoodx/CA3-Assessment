      <h2 class="header" >How was Aberdeen founded?</h2>
    <p style="padding: 5px;">There have been people living in Aberdeen since the stone age, and the city was split into two: Old Aberdeen and New Aberdeen. Old Aberdeen hosted the university and the cathedrals whereas new Aberdeen was where fishing occurred. Aberdeen was first settled in 6000 BC, Romans arrived in Aberdeen and fought and defeated the united armies near the peak of benachie. </p>
    <h2 class="header">The start of civilisation...</h2>
    <p style="padding: 5px;"><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/bruce_robert_the.shtml">Robert the Bruce</a> turned Aberdeen into a property owning and independent community, Aberdeen played a big role in Roberts life as they protected him during wars. Old Aberdeen was burned by Edward III of England but was soon rebuilt and extended, and for a while after Aberdeen were under attack by neighbouring lords.</p> 
    <p style="padding: 5px;">The castles affected by different attacks still remain as monuments and are available to visit. In 1647, we saw the outbreak of bubonic plague, and a quarter of the population died. In 1715 the Earl Marischal proclaimed the Old Pretender at Aberdeen, and in 1745 the Duke of Cumberland resided for a short time in the city before attacking the Young Pretender.</p>
